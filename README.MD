# Task manager on self wrote MVC MicroFramework

App was developed in case of code challenge for interview.
I used Eloquent ORM, which is using in Laravel.
Other components are wrote from scratch.

Spent 7 hours and it's very old project. Just for fun and education, to understand how MVC frameworks are exacty works.
Fell free to download and play with it.
